"""
Word Frequency Counter

This script reads a text file and counts the frequency of each word, ignoring case.

Usage: python word_frequency.py <input_file>


Your task:
- Complete the word_frequency() function to count word frequencies sorted alphabetically
- Test your script on 'alice_in_wonderland.txt'

Hints:
- Use a dictionary to store word frequencies
- Consider using the lower() method to ignore case
- The split() method can be useful for splitting text into words
